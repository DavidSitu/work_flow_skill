# Architecture Structure

Use this reference when creating, normalizing, or updating `ARCHITECTURE/`.

The WF architecture format is industry-aligned, not a full clone of any one framework. Use arc42-style coverage for goals and constraints, C4-style thinking for system views and boundaries, DDD/vertical-slice thinking for subsystem boundaries, and optional ADRs for important decisions.

Reference anchors:

- C4 model: https://c4model.com/
- ADRs: https://adr.github.io/

## Planning-First Architecture

For `$wf arche`, first determine whether the user wants exploration, an architecture plan, or direct documentation edits from accepted product, function, or UI direction.

- Ask only for missing intent that cannot be learned from existing docs or code.
- Use current code and current docs as runtime truth for what exists now.
- Treat provided product direction, rough function scope, UI/design input, constraints, tradeoffs, and target users as accepted user intent unless the user asks to challenge it.
- Do not invent business strategy, GTM, PMF analysis, pricing, promotion plans, or raw product positioning as part of normal WF architecture work.
- When architecture intent is unclear, clarify project goal, target users, in-scope and out-of-scope areas, constraints, system type, desired documentation depth, and whether ADRs are needed before writing docs.
- When the user asks for global view, overall architecture, whole project direction, MVP planning, final product direction, repo structure, or broad subsystem boundaries, read broadly across the relevant `ARCHITECTURE/current/` docs. Do not use a hard file cap for broad architecture work.
- When the user asks for MVP/V1, Post-MVP/V1.x, Future/V2+, roadmap, milestones, phases, or final-product direction, use `references/milestone-planning.md`.
- When the user provides a whole idea document at WF startup, distill accepted product truth into `01-05`. Keep a rich cleaned version of the idea in `01-project-intent.md`; do not store the raw full brief by default.
- When the user is in Codex Plan Mode, produce a decision-complete architecture plan before file changes.
- When the user has already specified the architecture change clearly, update the relevant docs directly.
- Do not update `TODO.md` for pure architecture discussion unless the architecture work becomes tracked project work.

## Folder Contract

Use this structure by default:

```text
ARCHITECTURE/
├── README.md
├── current/
│   ├── 01-project-intent.md
│   ├── 02-milestones.md
│   ├── 03-overall-system-design.md
│   ├── 04-overall-ui-design.md
│   ├── 05-repo-map.md
│   └── subsystems/
│       ├── README.md
│       └── <bounded-behavior>.md
├── decisions/
└── archive/
```

`decisions/` and `archive/` are optional. Create `decisions/` only when an architecturally significant decision exists. Create or read `archive/` only for historical context, migration history, or explicitly archived docs.

## Top-Level Files

- `ARCHITECTURE/README.md`: thin index for the architecture set, recommended reading order, folder meanings, and links to current docs, subsystem docs, decisions, and archive when present.
- `ARCHITECTURE/current/01-project-intent.md`: rich stable product intent: cleaned idea summary, goals, target users or customers, core problem, value proposition, product principles, scope, non-goals, key constraints, success direction, and current phase.
- `ARCHITECTURE/current/02-milestones.md`: compact product and architecture phase direction such as MVP/V1, Post-MVP/V1.x, optional Future/V2+, and final-product direction. MVP scope may include user journey flow, required pages, page-level capabilities, required buttons/controls, required states, and acceptance signal. It is not a backlog, TODO file, ADR, business plan, GTM plan, promotion plan, or file-by-file implementation checklist.
- `ARCHITECTURE/current/03-overall-system-design.md`: system boundaries, subsystem responsibilities, data flow, external dependencies, backend/frontend ownership, deployment/runtime shape, and shared terminology.
- `ARCHITECTURE/current/04-overall-ui-design.md`: UI design direction, visual language, navigation model, layout patterns, interaction conventions, responsive/accessibility expectations, and screenshot/prompt-derived UI decisions. It may start high-level before external UI design and become more concrete after the user provides screenshots, Figma-like prompts, images, or improved UI prompts. For backend-only, CLI-only, or library projects, keep the file and mark it `N/A` with a short reason.
- `ARCHITECTURE/current/05-repo-map.md`: folder responsibilities, entrypoints, major modules, ownership boundaries, generated or external code notes, and doc-to-code mapping.

## Subsystem Files

Use `ARCHITECTURE/current/subsystems/README.md` as the subsystem index and naming guide.

Create `ARCHITECTURE/current/subsystems/<bounded-behavior>.md` only when an area has meaningful behavior or complexity. Name subsystem docs by behavior boundary, not vague buckets. Use `references/subsystem-doc-template.md` for the content shape.

Prefer a few useful subsystem docs over many tiny files. A medium app often starts with roughly 4-8 subsystem docs, then expands only when work repeatedly needs more detail.

Use `references/subsystem-planning-rules.md` when deciding subsystem granularity, code ownership, public APIs, import rules, test strategy, or subsystem-by-subsystem refactor order.

Do not create subsystem docs per function, hook, widget, or UI page by default. A page or device capability becomes a subsystem only when it owns a real workflow, lifecycle, state, data contract, dependencies, or test surface.

## ADRs And Logs

Use `ARCHITECTURE/decisions/` for ADRs when a decision changes or constrains the architecture.

ADRs are not TODOs:

- `TODO.md` tracks current and near-next work sessions.
- `LOG.md` records completed session outcomes, handoffs, and short factual history.
- ADRs record why a significant architecture decision was made, what alternatives were considered, and what consequences future work must respect.

Create ADRs only for decisions future contributors would otherwise re-litigate or accidentally undo. Use simple numbered names such as `0001-use-managed-auth-provider.md`.

## Milestones And Roadmap

Use `references/milestone-planning.md` when `$wf arche` needs MVP/V1, Post-MVP/V1.x, optional Future/V2+, roadmap, phase, or final-product direction.

Keep milestone summaries compact inside `ARCHITECTURE/current/02-milestones.md`. Milestones guide architecture and session planning, but they are not TODO sessions or ADRs.

Detailed business logic, promotion, go-to-market, GTM, separate `PRODUCT/` docs, or a separate `05-roadmap.md` are out of scope for this architecture standard version.

## Accepted-Plan-To-Repo SOP

WF supports this sequence without adding new commands:

1. The user arrives with accepted business/product direction, rough function scope, and UI/design direction when available.
2. WF initializes or updates architecture docs, keeping rich accepted intent in `01`, milestone/function scope in `02`, system shape in `03`, UI/design direction in `04`, and repo mapping in `05`.
3. WF turns accepted milestone scope into session-sized `TODO.md` entries.
4. Code-manager guidance owns detailed code organization, imports, public APIs, tests, refactors, and implementation loops.
5. WF records completed outcomes in `LOG.md` and updates docs only when project truth changes.

## Update Boundaries

- Update `01-project-intent.md` when product goals, target customer, core problem, value proposition, product principles, users, scope, non-goals, constraints, stable success direction, or current phase changes.
- Update `02-milestones.md` when MVP/V1, Post-MVP/V1.x, Future/V2+, roadmap direction, milestone direction, phase direction, final-product direction, MVP user journey, page capability scope, required controls, required states, or acceptance signal changes.
- Update `03-overall-system-design.md` when system boundaries, ownership, data flow, dependencies, runtime shape, or shared terminology changes.
- Update `04-overall-ui-design.md` when UI design direction, visual language, navigation, layout patterns, interaction conventions, responsive/accessibility expectations, or screenshot/prompt-derived UI decisions change.
- Update `05-repo-map.md` when entrypoints, folder responsibilities, module ownership, generated code, or doc-to-code mapping changes.
- Update a subsystem doc when one bounded behavior area's flows, states, dependencies, code map, known gaps, or extension points change.
- Add an ADR when the reason behind an architecture decision matters beyond the current session.

## Bootstrap And Retrofit Checklist

- Create `ARCHITECTURE/README.md` and `ARCHITECTURE/current/`.
- Create the standard current docs using the current numbering. Keep `02-milestones.md` thin when milestone direction is not yet known, and use it when the project has active phase planning.
- Mark `04-overall-ui-design.md` as `N/A` with a short reason when the project has no UI.
- Create `ARCHITECTURE/current/subsystems/README.md`.
- Create subsystem docs only for clearly justified bounded behavior areas.
- Create `ARCHITECTURE/decisions/` only when recording an actual ADR.
- Create or preserve `ARCHITECTURE/archive/` only when historical docs exist or the user asks for archival structure.
- Prefer thin, accurate first-pass docs over speculative detail.

## Existing Repo Migration

- For new WF bootstraps, use the current numbering.
- For existing repos, do not blindly rename architecture files unless the user asks for retrofit or normalization.
- If old milestone content exists in `01-project-intent.md`, move only accepted milestone direction into `02-milestones.md`; keep stable project target content in `01-project-intent.md`.
- If existing `02-overall-system-design.md`, `03-overall-ui-design.md`, or `04-repo-map.md` exist, plan a safe rename to `03`, `04`, and `05` only when links and references can be updated cleanly.
- If renaming would create churn, preserve existing filenames and document the local structure in `ARCHITECTURE/README.md`.
