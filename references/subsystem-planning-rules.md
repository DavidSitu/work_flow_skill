# Subsystem Planning Rules

Use this reference when planning subsystem boundaries, repo layout, import rules, test ownership, or subsystem-by-subsystem refactors.

These rules combine C4-style component boundaries, DDD bounded-context thinking, vertical-slice architecture, and Feature-Sliced Design-style public APIs. They are guidance for repo-local code management, not a requirement to adopt any one framework.

## Definition

A subsystem is a bounded behavior area that owns meaningful code, state, interfaces, dependencies, and tests.

A subsystem is usually not:

- one function
- one hook
- one helper file
- one UI component
- one UI page by default

A page, device capability, or external integration becomes a subsystem only when it owns a real workflow, lifecycle, state machine, data contract, or test surface.

Example: `CameraButton` is not a subsystem. `camera-capture-and-upload` can be a subsystem if it owns permissions, preview lifecycle, capture, compression, upload, error states, and tests.

## Starting Granularity

For a medium application, start with roughly 4-8 subsystem candidates. Expand only when repeated work proves that a boundary needs its own document, code ownership, and tests.

Prefer subsystem names that describe bounded behavior:

- `auth-session-and-timezone`
- `media-capture-and-upload`
- `checkout-and-payment`
- `offline-queue-and-sync`

Avoid names that are only implementation buckets:

- `utils`
- `components`
- `pages`
- `services`
- `camera-button`

## Split Criteria

Split a subsystem when the candidate area has at least one strong reason:

- it has its own lifecycle, state machine, or business rules
- it owns data models, storage keys, tables, API contracts, or jobs
- it can be tested independently with meaningful fixtures or mocks
- it is reused by multiple pages, workflows, or entrypoints
- it changes for different reasons than the surrounding code
- it has distinct failure modes, permissions, or operational risks
- future contributors repeatedly need a focused doc to work safely

## Merge Or Avoid-Split Criteria

Do not create a separate subsystem when:

- the area is just a function, hook, widget, page shell, or small helper
- the proposed boundary cannot be tested alone
- the files always change together with another subsystem
- the split would create circular dependencies or chatty internal APIs
- the doc would mostly repeat another subsystem doc
- the only reason is matching the current folder structure

## Code Ownership Contract

Each subsystem should document:

- owned files and folders
- public entrypoints that other subsystems may import
- internal files that other subsystems should not import
- owned data, storage, APIs, jobs, or device capabilities
- allowed dependencies
- forbidden dependencies
- local unit or contract tests
- cross-subsystem integration tests

Prefer imports through a subsystem public API such as `index.ts`, `mod.rs`, or package-level exports. Avoid cross-subsystem imports from internal files unless the current task is explicitly correcting or documenting a temporary exception.

## Test Strategy

Use the smallest test surface that proves the behavior:

- Unit tests live with or near subsystem code.
- Contract tests prove public API behavior when the subsystem is consumed by others.
- Integration tests belong in a shared integration test area when behavior crosses subsystem boundaries.
- End-to-end tests should cover critical user journeys, not every internal branch.

Every subsystem doc should answer: how can this subsystem be tested by itself?

## Planning Flow

When asked to plan or refactor subsystem-by-subsystem:

1. Inspect current repo folders, entrypoints, tests, and architecture docs.
2. Identify behavior-based subsystem candidates, not just existing directories.
3. Map existing files to proposed subsystem owners.
4. Mark mixed-ownership or unclear files as temporary compatibility areas.
5. Define each subsystem's public API and forbidden internal imports.
6. Define local tests and cross-subsystem tests.
7. Refactor one subsystem or one integration boundary per session.
8. Add an ADR only when a boundary decision materially constrains future architecture.

## ADR Triggers

Create or update an ADR when:

- splitting or merging subsystems changes future ownership
- dependency direction changes
- a shared/platform layer is introduced
- data ownership or storage ownership changes
- an important architecture pattern is chosen over realistic alternatives
- a temporary boundary exception is accepted for a reason future work must know
