# Doc Update Rules

Use this file to decide which architecture doc should change.

## Architecture Shape

Use a two-layer architecture model by default:

- top-level docs for cross-cutting truth
- subsystem docs for bounded behavior areas

Stop at subsystem-level by default. Do not create per-function docs unless a function is unusually critical or complex.

For a medium or large app, prefer a small set of real subsystem docs before creating more. A good starting point is often 4-6 subsystem docs, not dozens of micro-docs.

Avoid too many tiny docs because they increase:

- file chasing
- duplicated facts
- doc drift
- the chance that one focused task requires opening many files

## Top-Level Docs

- Update `ARCHITECTURE/current/01-project-intent.md` when the product goal, target users, differentiator, scope, or phased direction changes.
- Update `ARCHITECTURE/current/02-overall-system-design.md` when subsystem boundaries, responsibilities, data flow, backend/frontend ownership, external dependencies, or terminology mappings change.
- Update `ARCHITECTURE/current/03-overall-ui-design.md` when surfaces, UX principles, navigation, state relationships, canonical UI language, or accessibility expectations change.
- Update `ARCHITECTURE/current/04-repo-map.md` when entrypoints, folder responsibilities, module ownership, or doc-to-code mapping change.

## Subsystem Docs

Create or update a subsystem doc when a change affects one specific area's:

- purpose or scope
- flows and transitions
- states and rules
- APIs, RPCs, jobs, or data dependencies
- code map
- known gaps
- safe extension points

Create a subsystem doc only when the area has one or more of these:

- meaningful business logic
- multiple modules or code paths
- important states or transitions
- backend and frontend interaction
- non-obvious constraints or likely future expansion

Name subsystem docs by bounded behavior, not vague buckets.

Prefer:

- `auth-session-and-timezone`
- `companion-lifecycle-and-reveal`

Avoid vague buckets such as:

- `login-system`
- `pet-system`

The goal is to name the behavior boundary a contributor actually needs to understand. Do not group unrelated behavior into one vague subsystem doc.

For a focused task, the ideal documentation read set is usually:

- `01-project-intent.md` only if product intent matters
- one relevant top-level doc
- one relevant subsystem doc
- `04-repo-map.md` only when code location is needed

If a focused task keeps requiring many scattered top-level docs, move the detailed behavior into a subsystem doc instead of fragmenting the top-level set further.

## Archive Rules

- Do not update `ARCHITECTURE/archive/` during normal current-state work.
- Move a document into `archive/` only when it is no longer current but still valuable for history.
- Consult `archive/` only for historical comparison, migration context, or explicit user requests.

## Drift Handling

If code and current docs disagree:

- treat code as runtime truth for what currently happens
- update `current/` if the runtime behavior is intentional and should become the new documented truth
- otherwise, record the mismatch in the relevant current doc and add a task in `TODO.md`
