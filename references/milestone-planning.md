# Milestone Planning

Use this reference when `$wf arche` needs to translate accepted roadmap, milestone, or product phase direction into compact architecture guidance.

Milestones are product and architecture direction. They are not execution sessions, TODO entries, ADRs, or business/promotion plans.

## When To Use

Use milestone planning when:

- accepted product direction includes MVP / V1, Post-MVP / V1.x, Future / V2+, roadmap, milestones, phases, or final-product direction
- the user asks WF to convert rough function scope or UI/user-flow direction into milestone architecture guidance
- architecture choices depend on the intended product phase
- a large request needs a roadmap before it can be split into sessions

Do not use milestone planning for every small architecture edit, and do not invent product strategy when accepted direction is missing. Ask for the missing direction or keep `02-milestones.md` thin.

## Storage Location

Store compact milestone summaries in `ARCHITECTURE/current/02-milestones.md`.

Keep `ARCHITECTURE/current/01-project-intent.md` focused on rich stable product intent: cleaned idea summary, goals, target users or customers, core problem, value proposition, product principles, scope, non-goals, constraints, current phase, and success direction.

Do not create a separate `ARCHITECTURE/current/05-roadmap.md`. Do not create `PRODUCT/`, business logic, promotion, go-to-market, or GTM docs as part of milestone planning.

## Milestone Format

Use the fewest milestone labels needed to make the roadmap clear. Prefer the user's existing vocabulary. For new WF projects, default to combined product/version labels:

`MVP / V1 -> Post-MVP / V1.x -> optional Future / V2+ -> Final Product Direction`

- `MVP / V1`: the first coherent user-facing product version or smallest version that proves the product value
- `Post-MVP / V1.x`: near-term improvements that should not block MVP
- `Future / V2+`: larger product generations added only when each version represents a meaningful capability jump toward the final goal
- `Final Product Direction`: the long-term north star, not a committed backlog

Existing or prototype-heavy projects may still use `V0 -> V1 -> optional V1.x -> optional V2+ -> Final Product Direction`. Treat `V0` as compatibility vocabulary only. Do not rename existing accepted labels unless the user asks for normalization.

Do not force `Future / V2+`. Add major versions only when the final goal is too complex for MVP plus Post-MVP. Use Post-MVP/V1.x for incremental improvements and Future/V2+ for distinct product generations.

For each milestone, capture only:

- Outcome: what becomes true for users or the system
- Included scope: what is intentionally part of the milestone
- Excluded scope: what is intentionally deferred
- Architecture implications: system boundaries, data, UI, integration, or subsystem consequences
- Acceptance signal: how the milestone can be recognized as complete enough

For `MVP / V1`, also capture compact product execution shape when UI or user flow matters:

- MVP user journey flow
- required pages or surfaces
- page-level capabilities and logic
- required buttons or controls
- minimum required states

This page capability scope belongs in `02-milestones.md` only at the functional level. Do not turn it into a full click-by-click script, visual layout spec, TODO backlog, or file-by-file implementation plan.

Keep milestone entries concise. Prefer 3-6 bullets per milestone over a long roadmap. If `V2+` exists, each major version should have a distinct outcome and acceptance signal.

`02-milestones.md` may be very short for small projects. Do not fill it with speculative versions just because the file exists.

## Relationship To TODO.md

Milestones guide session planning but do not belong in `TODO.md`.

- `TODO.md` contains current and near-next executable sessions only.
- A milestone may produce one or more session entries, but only for active or near-next work.
- Do not copy the full roadmap into `TODO.md`.
- Do not use milestone labels as session IDs; keep session IDs as `S1`, `S2`, `S3`.
- A milestone is not complete because the milestone doc exists. It is complete only when all derived implementation sessions are finished, verified, and recorded in `LOG.md`.

Use this mapping:

```text
Milestone = product capability direction
TODO session = one testable slice of that capability
Module/file = one coherent ownership boundary
Test = proof the session works
LOG = completion record for the verified session
```

## Planning Flow

1. Confirm only missing product goal, target users, scope, non-goals, constraints, and current phase that are not already present in the accepted input.
2. Draft `MVP / V1`, `Post-MVP / V1.x`, optional `Future / V2+`, and `Final Product Direction` only as far as the accepted input supports.
3. For MVP, include user journey and page capability scope when the product has pages or UI surfaces.
4. Use `Future / V2+` only for major capability jumps; otherwise keep the roadmap to MVP, Post-MVP, and Final Product Direction.
5. Identify architecture implications before proposing subsystem or repo changes.
6. Update `02-milestones.md` when milestones become accepted project direction.
7. Create or update `TODO.md` only if the milestone plan turns into tracked implementation work.
8. Mark milestone progress based on completed, verified, logged sessions rather than on documentation being written.

## Existing Repo Migration

- If accepted milestone content already exists in `01-project-intent.md`, move it to `02-milestones.md` during retrofit or normalization.
- Keep stable project target content in `01-project-intent.md`.
- Do not move stale roadmap ideas into `02-milestones.md`; preserve or archive them only when they remain useful historical context.
- Do not renumber existing architecture files unless the user asked for retrofit or normalization and the links can be updated cleanly.
